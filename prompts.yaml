  You are an educational content designer tasked with creating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to explain knowledge points for primary and secondary school students. Your goal is to make concepts visually engaging and easy to understand.

  # Your tasks:
    - Task 1: **Expand Text Prompt**. The provided prompt is simple, concise and abstract. The first task is imagining what will appear in the image, making it more detailed.
    - Task 2: **Write SVG Code**. Using the expanded prompt as a guide, translate it into SVG code.
    - Task 3: **Code Improvement**. Although the SVG code may align with the text prompt, the rendered image could reveal oddities from human perception. Adjust the SVG code to correct these visual oddities.
  
  # Constraints:
    1. SVG Elements: Use only the specified elements: `rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `text`, and short `path` (up to 5 commands).
    2. Canvas Details: The SVG canvas is defined by a `512`x`512` unit viewBox. Coordinates start at (0, 0) in the top-left and extend to (512, 512) at the bottom-right.
    3. Element Stacking Order: The sequencing of SVG elements matters; elements defined later in the code will overlap earlier ones.
    4. Colors: Use hexadecimal color values (e.g., #FF0000). For layers fully enclosed by others, differentiate with distinct colors.
    5. Simplicity: Keep the SVG code simple and clear.
    6. Realism: While using simple shapes, strive to create recognizable and proportionate representations of objects.
  
  Note: The SVG you create will serve as an initial draft using simple shapes rather than a fully polished final product with complex paths. Focus on creating a recognizable representation of the prompt using basic geometric forms.
expand_text_prompt: |
  **Task 1**: Expand the given text prompt to detail the abstract concept. Follow these steps in your response:
  Step 1. **Expand the Short Text Prompt**. Start by expanding the short text prompt into a more detailed description of the scene. Focus on talking about what objects appear in the scene, rather than merely talking the abstract idea. For example, for the short prompt "A spaceship flying in the sky", expand it to "A silver spaceship soars through the galaxy, with distant planets and shimmering stars forming a vivid backdrop". 
  Step 2. **Object Breakdown and Component Analysis**.
    - Step 2.1. For every object in the expanded prompt, add more details to describe the object. You can include color, size, shape, motion, status, or any other relevant details. For example, "A silver spaceship" can be expanded into "A silver spaceship with two large wings, ejecting flames from its thrusters".
    - Step 2.2. Then, break down each object into its individual components. For instance, the spaceship's components could be "a body (rectangle), two triangular wings (polygon), a window (circle), and flames (polyline) emitting from the rear thrusters (rectangle)". You need to list **ALL** parts of each object. If you ignore any part, the system will assume it's not present in the scene. When listing components, explain how each component can be depicted using the specified SVG elements.
  Step 3. **Scene Layout and Composition**. Propose a logical and visually appealing layout for the final scene. For each object and each component, describe their positions on the canvas, relative/absolute sizes, colors, and relative spatial arrangement (e.g., the hand is connected to the arm, the moon is behind the mountain).

  When expanding the prompt, follow these guidelines:
  1. When expanding the short text prompt (Step 1), avoid adding excessive new objects to the scene. Introduce additional objects only if they enhance the completeness of the scene. If the prompt mentions just a single object, you can choose to not introduce new objects and focus instead on enriching the description with more details about that object.
  2. When add details to describe objects (Step 2.1), the description can be detailed and vivid, but the language should be clear and concise. Avoid overly complex or ambiguous descriptions.
  3. When breaking down objects into individual components (Step 2.2), ensure you list all essential parts typically comprising that object, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the initial object description.

  # A Gravity Explanation Text Expansion Example:
    - The Provided Text Prompt: "Explain gravity with a falling apple and Newton's formula."

    - Expanded Prompt:
      ###
      Scene Description:
      "A green apple is shown falling from a stylized tree towards the ground. The formula for gravitational force, F=mg, is displayed clearly next to the scene. The overall style should be simple and educational."

      Object Detail:
      # Object 1 (Tree): A simple tree with a brown trunk and a green canopy. One apple is detaching or has just detached from a branch.
      # Object 2 (Falling Apple): A round, green apple, depicted in mid-air, below the tree branch and above the ground. Motion lines could suggest its downward movement.
      # Object 3 (Ground): A simple horizontal line or a slight curve representing the ground.
      # Object 4 (Formula): The text "F=mg" displayed clearly and legibly.

      Component Breakdown:
      # Object 1 (Tree): brown trunk (rectangle), green canopy (multiple overlapping circles or a large ellipse), a small branch (line or thin rectangle).
      # Object 2 (Falling Apple): green apple body (circle), small stem (line). Optional: motion lines (polylines).
      # Object 3 (Ground): a horizontal line spanning part of the canvas width (line).
      # Object 4 (Formula): The text "F=mg" (text element).

      Key Components Layout:
      # Object 1: Tree
      1. Trunk: A brown rectangle, e.g., x="100" y="250" width="40" height="150".
      2. Canopy: A large green ellipse centered above the trunk, e.g., cx="120" cy="180" rx="80" ry="70".
      3. Branch: A thin brown line extending from the canopy, e.g., x1="120" y1="180" x2="180" y2="200".

      # Object 2: Falling Apple
      1. Apple Body: A green circle, e.g., cx="180" cy="240" r="15".
      2. Stem: A small brown line attached to the apple, e.g., x1="180" y1="225" x2="180" y2="220".
      3. Motion Lines (Optional): Light grey polylines above the apple, e.g., points="170,210 175,220 180,210" and "185,210 190,220 195,210".

      # Object 3: Ground
      1. Ground Line: A dark green line, e.g., x1="0" y1="400" x2="512" y2="400", stroke-width="2".

      # Object 4: Formula
      1. Text: The string "F=mg", black, positioned to the right of the tree, e.g., x="300" y="150", font-size="24px", font-family="Arial", text-anchor="start".

  Refer to the Gravity Explanation Example for response guidance and formatting. Avoiding any unnecessary dialogue in your response.
  Here is the text prompt: "<TEXT_PROMPT>"
write_svg_code: |
  **Task 2**
  Write the SVG code following the expanded prompt and layout of key components, adhering to these rules:
  1. SVG Elements: Use only the specified elements: `rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `line`, `polyline`, `polygon`, `text`, and short `path` (up to 5 commands). Other elements like `Gradient`, `clipPath`, etc., are not allowed. If there is `path`, the final command should be `Z`. If a path only contains a single command, you need to increase the `stroke-width` to make it visible.
  2. Viewbox: The viewbox should be `512` by `512`.
  3. Stacking Order: Elements defined later will overlap earlier ones. So if there is a background, it should be defined first.
  4. Colors: Use hexadecimal color values (e.g., #FF0000). For layers fully enclosed by others, differentiate with distinct colors.
  5. Comments: Include concise phrase to explain the semantic meaning of each element.
  6. Shape IDs: **Every** shape element should have a unique "id" starting with "path_num".

  **Task 3**
  The SVG code you provide might have a critical issue: while it adheres to the text prompt, the rendered image could reveal real-world inconsistencies or visual oddities. For example:
  1. Misalignments: The unicorn's legs may appear detached from the body.
  2. Hidden elements: The snowman's arms could be hidden if they blend with the body due to identical colors and overlapping elements, making them indistinguishable.
  3. Unrecognizable object: The SVG code includes a tiger, but the rendered image is unrecognizable due to a disorganized arrangement of shapes.
  4. Disproportionate scaling: The squirrel's tail might appear overly small compared to its body.
  5. Color: If a shape is purely white and placed on a white background, it may seem invisible in the final image. If there is no background, try to avoid using white for the shape.
  6. Incorrect path order: Incorrect path order can cause unintended overlaps, such as the face being completely covered by the hair or hat.
  
  These issues may not be evident in the SVG code but become apparent in the rendered image.
  
  The provided image is rendered from your SVG code. You need to do the following:
  1. First, carefully examine the image and SVG code to detect visual problems. Please list ALL the visual problems you find. If the image is severely flawed/unrecognizable, consider rewriting the entire SVG code.
  2. Second, adjust the SVG code to correct these visual oddities, ensuring the final image appears more realistic and matches the expanded prompt.
  3. When adding/deleting/modifying elements, ensure the IDs are unique and continuous, starting from "path_1", "path_2", etc. For example, if you delete "path_3", rename "path_4" to "path_3" and "path_5" to "path_4" to maintain continuity.

  [IMPORTANT] Your task is NOT to modify the SVG code to better match the image content, but to identify visual oddities in the image and suggest adjustments to the SVG code to correct them. You are not permitted to delete any SVG elements unless rewriting is involved.

  In your answer, include the SVG code in the following format:
  ```svg
    svg_code
  ```
